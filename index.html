        <p>
          Most of my free time is spent either walking
          <b> my dog, Saoirse, </b>or playing games. I seem to enjoy any kind of
          game that involves management of resources or building production
          lines. You could probably very easily convince me to sit down for any
          type of board game or card game, I love the thought processes and
          competitiveness of games like that.

        <h2 class="right-column-title">Personal Profile</h2>
        <p>
          I am seeking my first Junior Development role, where I can continue to
          grow the skills I have gained from Northcoders and progress a career
          in this fast-paced industry! <br />
          Having worked in physical jobs for the last 5 years, I felt I was not
          getting the right mental stimulation - therefore I decided to change
          my future and enroll on a coding bootcamp. I find myself mulling over
          problems whilst walking the dog, and being kept up at night because I
          forgot to add a semi-colon to my code! It has been fun seeing myself
          using skills gained from previous employment and applying them to the
          code which I write.
        </p>
        <h2 class="right-column-title">NorthCoders</h2>
        <p>
          Developing a fundamental understanding of the Javascript programming
          language and implementing industry best-practices, such as creating
          algorithms, test-driven development and Git version control. <br />

          Delving into the intricacies of back-end, including pSQL queries, Node
          Postgres, and error-handling middleware. Concluded this section by
          developing the back-end for an API, and hosting it.<br />

          Learned some of the wide range of approaches to front-end, with a
          greater focus on React, including creating components, data fetching
          and custom react hooks. I dipped my toe into the ocean of CSS and
          concluded this section by developing the front-end for my API.<br />

          Coding social media site. We used agile methodology, daily stand ups
          and retro to finish off, to create a front end and back end. We
          implemented 2, new to us, technologies; MongoDB as our database and
          Cypress for front end testing.<br />

              Using PSQL and Express I built an API. You can make several
              different GET requests, 1 POST, 1 PATCH and 1 DELETE. It uses
              params in the more specific GET requests, also utilising queries
              and bodies attached to requests.
